## 🚀 The Roadmap

You will build multiple iterations of this project, where each version lives in a separate folder in the project repo. 

You'll start out by building Version 0, which is just the Frontend UI of the Home page. 

You'll end the course having build Version 5, which is a full-stack web application where you have built everything yourself: the frontend with React, the API with Express and Node.js, and the database with PostgreSQL. 

| Version | Feature | Where data is stored | 
| ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| 0 | Frontend UI only - Home page | No data stored. |
| 1 | Frontend UI only - Home page, SavedCountries page, CountryDetail page| No data stored. |
| 2 | Local Storage | Data is stored locally in the browser with Local Storage. |
| 3 | Supabase | Data is stored remotely in the Supabase database. I have no control over the data communication. |
| 4 | Local Postgres Database with API layer + Node.js | Data is stored in a local database, and I am responsible for how it is called and received (or placed) in the database. I control and have built all aspects of the data communication and the data storage in the database. |
| 5 | Remote Postgres Database with API layer + Node.js | I have deployed my database to a remote server! |
