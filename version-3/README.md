# Countries API Application - Version 3

## 👋 Welcome!

Instead of storing data in local storage, your Version 3 should store data remotely in Supabase. 

## 🎯 Requirements for Version 1

Include functionality in your Countries API project that stores and retrieves the following data from Supabase: 

1. **Form data**
    - As a user, when I submit the form, my data should be stored in the `users` table in Supabase. 
    - As a user, if I have already submitted the form, I should see "Welcome, [my name]!" instead of the form. 
2. **Saved Countries data**
    - As a user, on my Saved Countries page, I should be able to see all of the Saved Countries.
    - As a user, when I click the Save button in an individual country's page, I should be able to see that country's card in my Saved Countries page
3. **View Count data** 
    - As a user, when I open a country's page, I should be able to see how many times the user has viewed this country.
    - Every time I view a country's page, its view count should go up by 1. 

## 🔗 Resources

- **API:** You will use the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to get the country data and flag images

## 📝 Tips for building your project

1. **Pseudo-code before you write any code!** Look through the designs to plan out how you'll tackle the project. Write down your plan somewhere in this README or in your code.
2. **Work on one feature at a time.** Finish one feature first before you move onto the next thing. Test as you go, routinely checking your site in the browser and making sure there are no errors before moving on. 
3. **Comment your code generously — Future You will thank you.** You’ll be building on top of this project over the next 3 months, so help yourself out by writing clear, helpful comments that explain what your code is doing. Trust us, it will save you time and confusion later.
4. **Clean up your code as you go**. Rename confusing variables, remove unused code, and organize your logic. Your code should read like a newspaper: clear, easy to follow, and understandable at a glance.

## 🚀 Roadmap: Step-by-step guide to building Version 3
Make sure you've finished Version 1 before moving on with the following steps.

### Project Setup: Copy your files over 
1. Copy all of the files inside of your `version-2` folder
2. Paste all of the files into your `version-3` folder
3. Push your code to Github! You will use your `version-2` code as the starting point for your `version-3`. 

### Review your code 
1. Before you jump into writing and re-factoring code for your Version 3, first you should review what you've got so far. Review the code in the App.jsx file, the App.css file, each page, and each component. Consider where you will be storing and retrieving the 3 pieces of data (form, saved countries, and view count). 

### Storing Form data
1. Pseudo-code what you will need to do to store and retrieve the Form data. 
2. Work on storing Form data in Supabase. When the user submits the form, the form data should be stored in Supabase.
3. Work on retrieving Form data from Supabase. If the user has already submitted the Form, display "Welcome, {user}!" instead of the Form.
4. Comment the code you wrote so that Future You can understand it later.
5. Push your code to Github! 

### Storing Saved Countries data
1. Pseudo-code what you will need to do to store and retrieve the Saved Countries data.
2. Work on saving a country in Supabase. When the user saves a country, store the country's data in Supabase.
3. Work on retrieving the saved countries data from Supabase, so that they show on the Saved Countries page. 
4. Comment the code you wrote so that Future You can understand it later.
5. Push your code to Github!

### Storing View Count data 
1. Pseudo-code what you will need to do to store and retrieve the View Count data. 
2. When the user views a country's CountryDetail page, that country's view count should go up by 1. Also, the user should see how many times the country has been viewed. 
3. Comment the code you wrote so that Future You can understand it later.
4. Push your code to Github!

### Clean and Comment your code 
1. Clean up your code by renaming confusing variables, removing unused code, and organizing your logic. Your code should read like a newspaper: clear, easy to follow, and understandable at a glance.
2. Comment your code generously — Future You will thank you. You’ll be building on top of this project over the next 3 months, so help yourself out by writing clear, helpful comments that explain what your code is doing. Trust us, it will save you time and confusion later.
3. Push your code to Github!

### Deploy project to Netlify
1. Deploy your completed project to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) via your Github repo. In your Netlify Deploy settings, you will need to specify which version you want to deploy.
